# UFO Sightings
This repo contains files to make an interactive webpage containg data on UFO sightings. When first entering the page a full list of detailed UFO sightings can be seen. In the form box you can enter a date in order to filter the table. 

## Repo Contents
UFO-level-1 directory - This contains all the files necessary for this webpage
1. **index.html** This holds the html to make the webpage
1. static directory - This contails the js files for the app and the data
    1. css directory - contains all styling components for webpage
    1. images directory - contains all images for webpage    
    1. js directory - contains both **app.js** and **data.js** files. The **app.js** file contains the code necessary to poplate and filter the table. This also handl;es the click events. The **data.js** file contains the UFO data.
    
## Future Directions
I would like to work on changing the filter criteria to more than just the date. This would mean a change in the filtering and would also have to change the html so the user knows they could filter with items other than the date.
